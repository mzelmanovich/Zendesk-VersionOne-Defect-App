## Statuses
Most statues used by this app follow what is outline by [VersionOne](https://community.versionone.com/Help-Center/Common-Questions/Getting_Started_with_the_API). The following are exceptions added to fit my needs.

* Released - Defect/Story is closed and not Declined. Assumed that it was released
* Queued - Defect/Story was created but has no status currently
* Active - Catch all status for In Progress. Done for CSS reasons

## ToDo:

* Fix CSS for Long Statuses
* Better CSS colors for Statues
